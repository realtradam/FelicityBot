# About
@Felicity is a bot I made :D
It currently has the following features and with more possibly coming soon:
* !roll <number> to roll a dice
* !flip to flip a coin, it reacts the result
* !attack <@user> to make an attack on a user!
* There are a few easter eggs to do with attacking ;)
* !stats to view your combat statistics
* !list to show a list of animated emojis you can evoke from @Felicity use any of these emojis in a message and @Felicity will automatically replace them for you
* !react followed by one of the emojis listed in !list to have @Felicity react for you to the message above you(e.g !react !cheer)
* !mc to view minecraft server info(if the server is online, and what users are connected)
* !mc start to start the server. It will check to see if the server is already online so it will not start in that case
* !mc stop to halt the server. It will check if users are connected and will not shutdown until no one is connected
